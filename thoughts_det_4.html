McLaren Strategic Ventures (MSV) is a technology family fund that invests and incubates pre-series C startups (capital team) and provides IT services (solutions team) to Fortune500s. Strategically, the fund is incentivized to synergize the capital and solutions team to upsell technology products within services projects. In the past, we had successfully white-labelled a cybersecurity startup to provide advisory services (Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment, CISO Office as a Service, etc.) to clients, hyperscaling the fund’s revenue through the vested interest (compared to traditional IT services companies like Wipro, Infosys, and Accenture). Unfortunately, implementing every product in our services projects does not translate to immediate success. In Late 2021, we had embarked on a major technological change initiative to beta test a new Product Management tool (AKA PM Tool - currently incubated by the capital team similar to Microsoft Project, Asana, or others) across all services projects. Unfortunately, this was an error made by the organization. The change initiative was led by the founder of the PM tool, and he unfortunately did not understand the basics of change management. The change was mandated to Services Project A (a services project within MSV solutions). It was uncritical, superficial, and forcibly implemented on an ad hoc, fragmented basis. Uncertainty was not welcomed, and it was not understood that fears of the unknown are all intrinsic to successful change processes (especially the effectiveness of a new tool in an organization). The following paper analyzes on how certain decisions, culture, leadership, and other organizational systems contributed to the error under Lee Bolman and Terrence Deal’s 4 frames: Structural, Human Resource, Political, and Symbolic. The paper further suggests why these systems failed and areas of key improvement through each of these frames.           </p>
          <p>
The structural frame focuses on the existing structure of an organization or hierarchy. McLaren Strategic Ventures was started in December 2020 by a group of 8 successful entrepreneurs and changemakers. I joined in February of 2021 as the sole analyst (and an extension of the founding team). Each of the founding members had a specialization- General Counsel, CEO, CFO, COO, CTO, Sales and Marketing, and HR with the lead capital provider (the ‘family’ part of family fund) being the strategy setter. Control and Coordination from this capital provider was of the utmost importance. We had set goals and pushed each of our project and product teams in both solutions and capital. Quality is set by each subject matter expert in our team. Unfortunately, the PM tool incubated by the capital team didn’t meet the same structural standards as the core founding team, leading to eventual dysfunctionality across services projects when beta-testing. The overarching strategy of upselling products through a service catalogue made rational sense (with operational goals clearly mapped), but every part of the organization should follow the same structural rigor in their strategy and operations, including the parent company’s investments by extension (MSV’s portfolio of Pre-Series C startups). Daniel Coyle, in The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups states “Focus on people, specifically, on providing teams with tools and support to navigate the arduous process together”. The PM tool we were incubating and beta-testing (technology change initiative) as a part of Services Project A was dysfunctional and was a factor in leading the project to its demise. This can largely be attributed to the leadership style of the PM tool’s founder and the formation of bad teams within Services Project A. Compared to the effective structural style of leadership embodied by the founding team at MSV, the PM tool’s founder was plagued with an ineffective symbolic style of leadership. His strategy had no operational standards, with his dreams being merely smoke and mirrors. They displayed a grand yet blurry vision of how to set forth the beta-testing in Services Project A. As mentioned in Paper 2, the tool was still in its early stage of prototyping and evolving, almost on a weekly basis. The ineffective leadership style translated to the PM tool’s team itself, with updates (during beta-testing) being delayed and broken. The ineffectiveness spread to the tool itself and started molding into an obstacle in the structural frame of our organization by slowing down Services Project A.  What caused a further deceleration was the formation of bad unstructured teams (not accounted for in the ineffective leader’s blurry vision of the beta-testing) due to a lack of trust in the data present on the PM tool. The tool constantly lost data and was unable to track its origin (Data Authenticity). The Services Project A team was sent to battle with a slingshot. In summary, the structural frame is used to highlight key problems of Ineffective Leadership and Bad Teams on why the technology change initiative (Beta-testing in Services Project A and consequently slowing it down) failed. To fix this, in the future, I would recommend an MSV executive to lead the beta-testing (instead of the PM tool’s founder) and would have allowed for the use of ‘back-up’ or alternative tools during the course of Services Project A (API’s across technology tools). This ensures that both structure and choice are present in the organization.           </p>
          <p>
The human resource frame focuses on the organization’s people. MSV nurtured a culture of empowerment, creativity, and innovation. We were a lean and mean machine and time was our most valuable resource. As an analyst, I had direct contact with all 8 executives, in a caring and trustful work environment. It was understood that to be successful, everyone’s human needs had to first be met to maximize productiveness. Unfortunately, the PM tool incubated by the capital team didn’t meet the same human resource standards of culture as the core founding team, leading to eventual dysfunctionality across services projects when beta-testing. Culture is a common way of thinking which is translated into common and integrated ways of behaving. There was no unity of identity between MSV and the PM tool, which consequently led to mismatched strategies. Daniel Coyle, in The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups states “Culture is a set of living relationships working toward a shared goal. It’s not something you are. It’s something you do”. The PM tool we were incubating and beta-testing (technology change initiative) as a part of Services Project A was dysfunctional. This can largely be attributed to a lack of motivation and staff development. Using the PM tool made the team feel incompetent and powerless, which led to a lack of authentic motivation in using it.  No choice in beta-testing the PM tool (the how of work) was a constraint on behavior. What caused a further problem, was there was no concrete training on how to use the PM tool, and no follow through once beta-testing started. Ongoing assistance would have been critical during this period, but the PM tool team was nowhere to be found to be supportive or encouraging. This slowed the information flows within the Services Project A team, leading to client disengagement. In summary, the human resource frame is used to highlight key problems of motivation and lack of staff development on why the technology change initiative (Beta-testing in Services Project A and consequently slowing it down) failed. To fix this, in the future, I would recommend the PM tool team to create a 1-week gamified training seminar (or courses) where the Services Project A team could have built key skills (and motivation) to use the tool. There needs to be constant communication and flow of information between both teams (with an integration of culture) for the beta-testing to be successful.           </p>
          <p>
The political frame focuses on power. Because MSV’s core founding team were 8 executives, from very different backgrounds, there was a constant power struggle across products and projects in capital and solutions. People often jockeyed for position in the organization, with the first CEO fired merely after 9 months. As an analyst, it was important for me to understand where the power lied in the organization, and how to use it effectively (Chief of Staff to the Founder was my go-to). Unfortunately, the PM tool incubated by the capital team didn’t meet the same political standards due to a lack of stakeholder buy-in from the solutions team leading to the eventual dysfunctionality across services projects when beta-testing. The founding team of 8 never used the tool itself with only the team from Services Project A (in solutions) paying the price of ineffectiveness. The PM tool we were incubating and beta-testing (technology change initiative) as a part of Services Project A was dysfunctional and was a factor in leading the project to its demise. This can largely be attributed to bad negotiation and conflict resolution skills. There were competing interests between the PM tool team and the Services Project A team due to mismatching expectations which led to conflicts. Albert Einstein is famously quoted as stating “There’s been a quantum leap technologically in our age, but unless there’s another quantum leap in human relations, unless we learn to live in a new way towards one another, there will be a catastrophe”. There were no arenas for such conflict (with rules, roles, and referees) to air and negotiate differences in how the tool was being beta-tested into Services Project A. It seemed like only the PM tool team was benefitting from the wealth of feedback (feature requests) coming from the Services Project A team creating winners and losers in the interaction. There was a lack of symmetrical risk in the change initiative ‘transaction’ with the latter having to risk the entire project to test the tool. In summary, the political frame is used to highlight key problems of bad negotiation and conflict resolution skills on why the technology change initiative failed. To fix this, in the future, I would recommend the PM tool team to create rewards and incentives for the Services Project A team during or after the beta-testing. Moreover, obtaining the buy-in of the solution team, before a change initiative starts, would have been crucial to test whether beta-testing is even a possibility for the specific project.           </p>
          <p>
The symbolic frame focuses on vision and inspiration. Eventhough MSV was a very structured organization, there are still questions that cannot be answered, problems that cannot be solved, and events that cannot be understood or managed. It is hard to create symbols for the ambiguous, and the PM tool was facing a similar challenge. PM tools are unique in that they set order to the chaos of managing products/ideas, teams, and the people within them. The dysfunctionality in Services Project A could be attributed to a lack of story-telling skills from the PM tool’s founder. As mentioned previously, the Product founder had an ineffective symbolic style of leadership as they had underestimated the feelings of loss (of capability) that came about in introducing a new tool to a team. They were unable to inspire the team on why a change was required (overarching vision) and did not provide any meaning behind their actions or ideas. Their stories, during meetings, did not spark action, did not transmit key values, did not foster collaboration, and did not lead people into the future of managing products (through their tool). Michael Margolis stated “Storytelling is about connecting to other people and helping people to see what you see”. No one saw what the founder was strategizing regarding the future. In summary, the symbolic frame is used to highlight key problems of poor story-telling ability on why the technology change initiative failed. To fix this, in the future, I would recommend the founder of the PM tool to give weekly talks on the vision (and weekly updates) being made to the tool. It would also be beneficial for the founder to acknowledge feedback and create immediate productivity gains during beta-testing.          
          </p>
          <p>
In conclusion, the beta-testing technological change initiative had failed (as evidenced by Services Project A’s failure) due to an Ineffective Leadership style (of the PM tool’s founder), formation of bad teams (Within Services Project A), Poor Motivation, No Staff Development plans, bad negotiation, poor conflict resolution skills, and a lack of storytelling skills as analyzed in the 4 frames: Structural, Human Resource, Political, and Symbolic. These mistakes could have been avoided, if we had used Lee Bolman and Terrence Deal’s frameworks to source solutions that would have promised success.
