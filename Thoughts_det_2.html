          <h5>My Faces of Innovation (Before and During MSV)</h5>
          <p>
            <em>The Hurdler:</em> Math was one of my favorite subjects growing
            up. I enjoyed how a math problem could have multiple methods to
            solving for the correct answer. Unlimited perspectives to a singular
            problem. Post-Graduation (UC Berkeley Class of 2020), I was
            passionate to recreate the concept of ‘work’ by creating an HRMS
            Product. My cofounder and I had a personal budget of $50,000 to
            create an MVP product in 8 months that could disrupt traditional
            recruiting and people management. Innovating under constraints was
            challenging but the lack of resources (time, money, and skills) only
            motivated us to work smarter and the added risk of being jobless
            only excited us. But, as the 8 months started to expire, we were
            faced with a key hurdle: Investment. Unfortunately, after weeks of
            networking and pitching our HRMS product, we were staring down the
            same wall of an empty bank account. I was too stubborn to move-on
            and wanted to maintain a quiet and positive determination to impact
            the community of job seekers. As a hurdler, I was able to turn this
            obstacle into an opportunity. If we could get invested for the
            product, was it possible to get invested for the people? I wanted to
            create an impact on my community as an entrepreneur, but I did not
            have to do it with the HRMS product. I then decided to join one of
            the funds (MSV) I had pitched to as a Growth Analyst in a full-time
            role. I was able to solve the problem of Investment, by pivoting my
            perspective on what needed to be funded. Growing my experience and
            skills as an entrepreneur was more important and the right answer
            while the success of the product was not necessarily needed to
            create that impact (at that point of time). My Hurdler persona
            allowed me to pivot my resources (time, money, and skills) to a
            larger platform (the fund) to impact the communities I cared about
            through entrepreneurship.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The Cross Pollinator:</em> Traveling and living in a new city
            once every three years of life gave me the ability to learn quickly
            (adaptability and curiosity) and empathize with different types of
            people around the world. MSV was led by 10 executives, all with
            niche areas of expertise, with me as the sole analyst. Since I
            reported to these executives, who were respective leaders of their
            functions (CFO, CTO, General Counsel, etc.), I acted as the glue
            that could translate and drive for success across these siloed
            functional areas. As an entrepreneur with experience in developing
            products, I was able to provide interesting input for each of the
            executives on project work, whether it was creating draft legal
            contracts for my general counsel or creating commercial models for
            my COO. Moreover, since we were a technology fund, I believe my wide
            interests in technology (Datascience, Cloud, AI/ML, and other
            Technology Infrastructure products and services) and an aptitude for
            teaching also benefited the fund as we explored startups to invest
            in, mentored product founders, or incubated new products/services.
            Specifically, as a part of MSV, I was the lead Product Manager for a
            Reg-tech Startup. Due to my unique background, we were able to
            borrow principles of cybersecurity program management into
            regulation technology (Policy Management, Controls, Regulations,
            etc.). My Cross-Pollinator persona helped me break traditional
            operational and technical siloes to provide value to the fund
            horizontally.
          </p>
          <h5 class="mb-0">Improvements to my Faces of Innovation</h5>
          <p>
            Although I believe I carry the personas of the Hurdler and the Cross
            Pollinator, there needs to be improvements made in how I learn and
            build. Empathy (through desirability) must be baked into the
            learning and building processes to bring business benefits to an
            organization. I don’t intend to be the best at each of these
            personas, but I would like to achieve true excellence in a few areas
            and strength in many. I would like to focus on strengthening my
            Anthropologist and the Experience Architect personas by improving my
            skills in the following areas:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Reduce bias and practice the principle of the “beginner’s mind” by
              being more open minded to new ideas, especially during Discovery
              or Ideation Sprints at my workplace.
            </li>
            <li>
              Observe, don’t judge and find intrinsic rewards to learning
              about/from other people. Unfortunately, extrinsic motivation can
              only get you so far in carrying a good Anthropologist persona.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use my skills as a Cross Pollinator and Hurdler to better listen
              to my intuition in drawing insights about human behavior. The ten
              faces have complementary skills that could be used interchangeably
              when making improvements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notice new or broken things (looking beyond what is visible, even
              in ‘trash cans’) in daily lives to sharpen observation skills.
            </li>
            <li>
              Draw on all available experiences of my lifetime from a locker of
              experiences (merit badging) and constantly add to them. I want to
              be a constant learner, and new experiences unlocks observations on
              what I see and why.
            </li>
            <li>
              Innovate on Experiences (and the respective journeys of the
              consumer) beyond traditional product systems by focusing on
              trigger points. As a technology fund, we would primarily compete
              on products, but by improving my skills as an Experience
              Architect, I want to be able to empathize and provide a more
              rewarding experience to consumers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Promote Authenticity (and what is real, honest, and meaningful) in
              experiences as it related to the organization, products/services,
              the customers, digital interactions, events, and my internal
              teams.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Moving Forward</h5>
          <p>
            Moving forward, I plan on using a combination of the Hurdler, Cross
            Pollinator, The Anthropologist and The Experience Architect faces
            across learning, organizing, and building, as a Product Manager.
            Practicing and Improving on the above skills would be crucial in
            adding empathy to my operational and technical breadth (discussed
            above) to become a more holistic T-Shaped Person. I plan on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Adding guest members (of a different face of Innovation) to daily
              scrum calls or discovery sessions to source alternative methods of
              solving key problems (cross-pollination or collaboration).
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding powerful internal tools (with the recommendations of a Set
              Designer) in our armory to impact the behavior and attitude of
              people and the speed and convenience of innovation in our
              organization.
            </li>
            <li>
              Focus on Empathy within teams, events, organizations to design
              products/services that meet human needs by understanding human
              behavior and attitudes (A focus on qualitative research, in
              conjunction to quantitative).
            </li>
            <li>
              Bring more observations and insights of my experiences into key
              meetings while continuously creating new experiences through my
              personal hobbies (Dirt Bikes, Traveling, and Food)
            </li>
            <li>
              Seek out and pitch diverse projects (under the mission of MSV)
              that could be cross- pollinated to my boss. For example: Applying
              the principles of a cybersecurity program to AI/ML Governance.
            </li>
            <li>Faces and Organization</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I believe an organization needs to hire for a good mix of faces or
            personas to be truly innovative and successful. Combining several
            personas together and blending them into a multi- disciplinary team
            creates complementary effects in generating a positive force for
            innovation. As a recruiter, I would hire individuals based on where
            they fit in the 10 different personas so that the team or
            organization could add up to a healthy score and mix of faces. As
            stated in the Ten Faces of Innovation, this would allow you to
            create a team that outperforms competition in the full range of
            daily tests that every company faces. Mixing such different
            personalities allows for creative abrasion and organizational
            progress at the people (or HR) level.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could recognize these personas in a traditional organizational
            structure by tagging your workforce based on the personas they
            exhibit strengths in. You could change the composition of teams
            (depending on the project) based on these personas to have them be
            complementary. For example, you might want a software engineer who
            is an anthropologist, a product manager who is a collaborator, a
            designer who is a storyteller, and a founder that is a hurdler to
            start creating a new product/service. You do not need to get rid of
            traditional roles already existing in the organization that define
            function (which possesses roots in how the military is managed).
            Moreover, in such an organization, I would look for bosses or
            mentors who nurture a complementary set of personas that could
            benefit my professional growth. Personally, I would look for an
            anthropologist or an experience architect type boss or mentor
            (regardless of traditional roles) who I could trust, not only in
            creating value to the organization, but value in myself, in the
            context of innovation.
