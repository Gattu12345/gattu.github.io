            When a complex change such as the 5th Industrial Revolution, nicknamed the Age of Artificial Intelligence, is on the horizon (recently going through the Innovation Trigger, on the Gartner Hype Cycle, in November 2022), people or organizations do not and cannot change by being told to do so. The Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence Executive Order, published on October 30th, 2023, forces change (to guide industry and avoid discrimination) by creating a ‘safety’ mandate with unintended consequences. I strongly believe that this Executive Order is a major problem to organizations as it is uncritical, superficial and being forcibly implemented on an ad hoc, fragmented basis, which is against the principles of change.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, the Executive Order is uncritical due to its very nature of it being an Order. As Steven Sinofsky puts it “The creation of an executive order is not subject to the same levels of transparency and accountability as is the legislative process”. Successful complex change requires friction & debate and is a journey of innovation (of the plan and the change itself). An ordered plan, such as the EO, is set out to be the ‘law of the land’ that impedes such change and the journey of innovation to achieve it. You cannot mandate things that require higher-level thinking or that can be monitored through close and constant surveillance. Thankfully, we are not too late. We have seen EO’s being challenged and struck down as is with the case of Trump and his early EO’s banning citizens of certain Muslim countries from entering the U.S. The EO is forcibly mandating an ordered plan that is against the principles of change. The key to success lies in the innovative activity of making new maps (Stacey 1992), that a legislative process (in the context of the EO), could achieve. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Executive Order is superficial (provides a false sense of clarity) as it does not take into consideration the ambiguous technical features of modern AI systems. How do you operationalize an ordered plan if the change required is so complex? The EO states “it is necessary to hold those developing and deploying AI accountable to standards that protect against unlawful discrimination and abuse”. How do you measure how ethical an LLM is to protect the interests of American/Global Citizens? Unfortunately, it is too early to do so. LLM’s are still ‘blackboxes’, especially to the researchers themselves, with their outputs constantly questioned (For example, spurious correlations picked up by LLM’s beyond human pattern recognition capabilities could be biased). The EO looks at what can be governed and not what should be as it does not understand the full ambiguous technical nature and assumes linearity in how LLMs are evolving. There have been examples in history where advancements in technology (blockchain, social networking, cloud, and microprocessors) have created fast complex changes in our lives, with no EO. So why create mandates on such change now? Premature clarity and not accounting for the unpredictability in the evolution of AI Systems is against the principles of change. Uncertainty is needed as innovation, anxiety, difficulties, and fears of the unknown are all intrinsic to successful change processes, especially at the early stages of the 5th Industrial Revolution. The EO does not consider this, and the office’s lack of technical maturity is apparent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, the Executive Order is being implemented on an ad hoc, fragmented basis with no holistic consideration of our technofuture. There are very limited examples of Executive Orders not being used as political tools to garner emotional votes. At the turn of each presidency, EO’s are broken apart and not accounted for (as seen with Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden first few weeks in office). As Steven Sinofski puts it, “Such an approach is akin to trying to build something amazing while working with a constant threat of a reorg or having resources pulled out from under the team”. I believe that not having the EO in the first place, would allow for innovation in AI systems to foster, creating successful organic change (or revolution) and would truly be the semblance of a planned journey into uncharted waters in a leaky boat with a mutinous crew (Fullan 1995). You need the crew (in the first place) for them to be mutinous, and unfortunately, the design of EO’s impede the constant progress we need for a transparent, regulated, and equitable technofuture we have all imagined for ourselves.   
          </p>
          <p>
           In Conclusion, The Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence Executive Order forces change through a mandate that is against the principles of change. It is uncritical, superficial and implemented on an ad-hoc basis that aims to stifle innovation – a key in the journey to successful change. The 5th Industrial is upon us, and I believe we must be more accepting of its non-linearity, unpredictability, and uncertainty to thrive. People, or organizations, cannot be mandated to change.
