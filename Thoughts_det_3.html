The sport of soccer is one that is enjoyed by billions of people around the globe, including yours truly. Harry Kane is one of the most influential soccer players of our modern times, creating a timeless mark on the Barclays Premier League (Tottenham Hotspur - UK) and the national english football team. Harry Kane made recent headlines for transferring to Bundeslega (Bayern Munich - Germany) for a reported hundred million euros. This move brought him back into the spotlight with an article (linked above) highlighting why he was picked as captain to lead England’s football team since 2018. I believe Harry Kane was chosen to lead because he had initially built credit with key stakeholders (including Gareth Southgate – England’s GM), has shown key leadership competencies, and has a leadership style embodied by few.           </p>
          </p>
          <p>
Gareth Southgate is popular for his brilliant management style (compared to previous managers) in reuniting the squad over its tense domestic rivalries. The article states “Southgate took his squad for a surprise weekend at Commando Training Centre Royal Marines in Devon which helped him decide his skipper”. The Marines tested the team’s physical and mental strength through a series of team building exercises, which Harry Kane passed with flying colors. He was able to build credit among his teammates, marines, and key stakeholders of the English Football team during this camping and hiking trip (Credit Model of Leadership). Moreover, Kane had already proven himself, countless times, on the field with his technical expertise in scoring goals and making plays - which only made his election smoother.           </p>
          </p>
          <p>
Harry Kane has been known to show key leadership competencies on and off the pitch. Alex Inglethorpe, former Tottenham Academy Director, states “Harry was always someone who was going to get better just by the sheer volume of work he was willing to do, and by the mentality he would demonstrate on a daily basis to invest in himself. He had a fantastic desire to improve and would always want to do extra work at the end of a session.” Harry Kane shows various qualities of character, personal capability, focus on results, interpersonal skills, and leading organizational (team) change. He practices self-development, is innovative in his play on the field, and carries the technical and professional expertise to lead his team (at Bayern Munich) to future successes. He has also shown to inspire and motivate his teammates to high performance - At the Qatar World Cup, Kane was seen wearing anti-discrimination armbands to spread the broader message of inclusion and diversity in the football community. These key leadership competencies make it clear why he is captaining the English football team today. 
          </p>
          <p>
Based on the book How Great Leaders Think by Lee G. Bolman and Terrence E. Deal, great structural leaders focus on detail and implementation. Harry Kane’s move out to Bayern Munich was controversial with him ridiculing Tottenham of not having a ‘top club’ mentality. Even though he was individually successful (all-time record goal scorer for the club), he was unable to assist his team to win the Barclays Premier League. He was quoted saying “a lot needs to change at Tottenham if the team are to start being successful again” highlighting his process oriented / structural style of leadership. Kane’s move to Bayern Munich has been a big experiment to challenge himself and grow as a leader. So far, he seems to have already impacted his new club, winning ten out of the twelve games in the 2023-24 season. This same style of leadership is required to also bring the English National football team to the forefront of success in UEFA Euro matches in the summer of 24.           </p>
          </p>
          <p>
In Conclusion, I believe Harry Kane was elected (by Gareth Southgate) to lead the English football team at the national stage because of his ability to build credit (among key stakeholders), his key leadership competencies, and his unique leadership style. He is England’s only hope to bringing glory back home, and it is clear to see why.          </p>
